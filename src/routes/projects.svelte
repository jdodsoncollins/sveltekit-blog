	When I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause asked him: "In God's name,
	what does it all mean? Was she, or is she, mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?" I was so
	bewildered that I did not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the paper,
	saying:--

	"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know and understand it all in

	"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act properly and wisely, there may
	be an inquest, and that paper would have to be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no
	inquest, for if we had it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you know,
	and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra had disease of the heart, and we
	can certify that she died of it. Let us fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it
	myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker."

	"Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be sad in the foes that beset
	her, is at least happy in the friends that love her. One, two, three, all open their veins for
	her, besides one old man. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the more for
	it! Now go."
