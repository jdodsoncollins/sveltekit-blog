	his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his
	father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as
	to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to
	raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his
