# SvelteKit blog

Relatively basic [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) blog-style website with no database, for easy JAM stack deployment. The goal of this project was to play with Svelte.

This project was originally a clone of [https://hagura.sveltethemes.dev/](https://hagura.sveltethemes.dev/) so I could bootstrap something that could read markdown posts, but since then has seen some expansion.

## Features

- Image viewer
- Typescript + eslint + prettier
- Markdown blog posts
- Pagination using [svelte-paginate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-paginate)
- Supports svelte components in markdown files
- TailwindCSS styles
- Basic SEO
- Netlify adapter(change for your requirement)

## Installation

1. Clone directory, and `cd` into the root level of it
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` for development server
4. see it in action on `localhost:3001`

See `scripts` section in `package.json` for others
